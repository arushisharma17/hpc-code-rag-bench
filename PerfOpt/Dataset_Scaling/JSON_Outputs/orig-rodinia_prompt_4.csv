  ""questions"": [
    {
      ""Question"": ""What is the impact of not setting the number of threads for the OpenMP parallel region in the code shown?"",
      ""Answer"": ""By not setting the number of threads for the OpenMP parallel region with `omp_set_num_threads(num_omp_threads);`, the runtime system will choose the number of threads to use, which might not be optimal. It will typically default to the maximum number of threads available on the system. Setting the number of threads may provide better control over resource utilization and performance optimization.""
    },
    {
      ""Question"": ""How can the allocation and initialization of the arrays such as 'h_graph_mask', 'h_updating_graph_mask', and 'h_graph_visited' be optimized to improve parallel execution performance?"",
      ""Answer"": ""The allocation and initialization of the arrays can be optimized by parallelizing the initialization loop with an OpenMP `#pragma omp parallel for` directive. This will allow multiple threads to initialize different parts of the array concurrently, which can lead to better cache utilization and reduced initialization time.""
    },
    {
      ""Question"": ""What's the benefit of using first-touch memory initialization in the context of the BFS algorithm implemented in the code?"",
      ""Answer"": ""First-touch memory initialization ensures that memory pages are allocated on the memory nodes closest to the CPU executing the thread that first touches that memory. For BFS, it can lead to improved memory locality, reduced memory access latencies, and better overall performance, especially on NUMA architectures.""
    },
    {
      ""Question"": ""Is there a performance impact of the potentially false sharing occurring in the arrays 'h_graph_mask', 'h_updating_graph_mask', and 'h_graph_visited'? If so, how can it be mitigated?"",
      ""Answer"": ""Yes, there is a potential performance impact due to false sharing of these arrays. False sharing can be mitigated by padding the arrays to ensure that each element is on its own cache line, or by redesigning the algorithm to minimize writes to shared data. Alternatively, using local flags for each thread and combining the results after computation can also reduce the occurrence of false sharing.""
    },
    {
      ""Question"": ""How does the dynamic nature of the BFS frontier affect the choice of scheduling strategy for the OpenMP parallel loop and what would be an appropriate scheduling directive?"",
      ""Answer"": ""The dynamic nature of the BFS frontier means that the workload may be irregular and imbalanced across iterations of the loop. An appropriate scheduling directive could be `#pragma omp parallel for schedule(dynamic,chunk_size)` where `chunk_size` is a granular chunk of loop iterations that can be dynamically assigned to threads, allowing for load balancing among the threads.""
    },
    {
      ""Question"": ""What OpenMP clause could be added to the parallel loop to ensure that the variable 'stop' is properly synchronized between threads?"",
      ""Answer"": ""The `stop` variable should be thread-private during the loop execution and then reduced at the end of the loop. The OpenMP reduction clause `#pragma omp parallel for reduction(\\|:stop)` can be used to ensure that the variable is properly synchronized between threads by performing a logical OR operation across all thread-local copies of 'stop'.""
    },
    {
      ""Question"": ""Why is it important to use the 'omp_get_wtime()' function and what is the effect of not calling it outside of the OpenMP region?"",
      ""Answer"": ""The 'omp_get_wtime()' function retrieves the current wall clock time from the OpenMP runtime system. It is important to use it for performance measurement as it provides more accurate and consistent timing across different systems. Not calling it outside of the OpenMP region can lead to measuring not just computation time but also the overheads associated with entering and exiting parallel regions, leading to inaccurate performance data.""
    },
    {
      ""Question"": ""How can vectorization be applied to this BFS algorithm to further improve performance and what changes would be required?"",
      ""Answer"": ""Vectorization can be applied by using OpenMP SIMD directives to vectorize the inner loop that iterates over the graph nodes' edges. Changes would include ensuring that data structures are aligned in memory and that there are no dependencies that would prevent vectorization. Additionally, the code may need to be refactored to use operations that can be effectively vectorized by the compiler.""
    },
    {
      ""Question"": ""In the context of the code provided, how would the 'collapse' clause affect the performance of the nested loop structure?"",
      ""Answer"": ""There isn't an explicit nested loop structure presented in the provided code that is amenable to collapsing with OpenMP. However, if there were nested loops, the 'collapse' clause could collapse the specified number of nested loops into one larger iteration space, which might improve cache utilization and provide more even work distribution among threads, potentially improving performance.""
    },
    {
    ""Question"": ""What kind of OpenMP memory directives could be employed to optimize data movement between the host and target devices in the presence of the 'OMP_OFFLOAD' flag?"",
    ""Answer"": ""When the 'OMP_OFFLOAD' flag is present, directives such as `#pragma omp target enter data`, `#pragma omp target exit data`, and `#pragma omp target update` could be used to optimize data transfer between the host and target devices (such as GPUs). These directives give fine-grained control over when and which data is moved to minimize data transfer overheads.""

  ""Questions"": [
    {
      ""Question"": ""What optimization can be applied when initializing the `clusters` center points to ensure better cache locality?"",
      ""Answer"": ""To optimize cache locality during the initialization of cluster center points, you can use a block or tiled approach to assign the center points. This approach improves the likelihood that the data will reside in the cache when accessed, leading to reduced cache misses.""
    },
    {
      ""Question"": ""In the `find_nearest_point` function, which OpenMP directive can be used to parallelize the loop to reduce the computational time?"",
      ""Answer"": ""To parallelize the loop within the `find_nearest_point` function, you can use `#pragma omp parallel for` directive before the loop. This will allow each thread to work on a portion of the iterations concurrently, thus reducing the computational time.""
    },
    {
      ""Question"": ""How can you use OpenMP to parallelize the random initialization of clusters to improve performance?"",
      ""Answer"": ""Using `#pragma omp parallel for` before the loop that randomly initializes the clusters can help in parallelizing the process. Each OpenMP thread can initialize a subset of cluster centers. Additionally, to avoid race conditions, make sure to use thread-private random number generators or use critical section for the actual random number generation.""
    },
    {
      ""Question"": ""What OpenMP clause should be added to the `#pragma omp parallel for` directive to specify that `min_dist` and `index` within `find_nearest_point` should not be shared among threads?"",
      ""Answer"": ""To ensure `min_dist` and `index` are not shared, you should add the `private(min_dist, index)` clause to the `#pragma omp parallel for` directive. This ensures each thread has its own copy of these variables, preventing race conditions.""
    },
    {
      ""Question"": ""To reduce false sharing in the `new_centers_len` array, what strategy can be adopted using OpenMP?"",
      ""Answer"": ""To reduce false sharing in the `new_centers_len` array, padding can be added to each element to ensure that each one resides on a separate cache line. Alternatively, use the `#pragma omp parallel for reduction(+:new_centers_len[:nclusters])` directive so that each thread accumulates results privately and combines them at the end of the parallel region.""
    },
    {
      ""Question"": ""Which OpenMP scheduling technique is most suitable for balancing the load in the main loop of the `kmeans_clustering` function where each iteration may take different amounts of time to process?"",
      ""Answer"": ""For load balancing in the main loop of the `kmeans_clustering` function, you can use `#pragma omp parallel for schedule(dynamic, chunk_size)` where `chunk_size` is a parameter chosen based on the problem size and system. Dynamic scheduling allows threads to pull the next available chunk once they finish their current one, which helps in balancing uneven workloads.""
    },
    {
      ""Question"": ""How can the reduction in the sum of squared distances `delta` be implemented using OpenMP in the `kmeans_clustering` function?"",
      ""Answer"": ""The reduction in the sum of squared distances `delta` in the `kmeans_clustering` function can be implemented using the `reduction(+:delta)` clause in an OpenMP directive, such as `#pragma omp parallel for reduction(+:delta)`. This allows each thread to calculate a partial sum, which is then combined with the sums from other threads.""
    },
    {
      ""Question"": ""What OpenMP feature would you use to ensure that the updates to `new_centers` and `new_centers_len` are performed atomically in the `kmeans_clustering` function?"",
      ""Answer"": ""To ensure that updates to `new_centers` and `new_centers_len` are atomic, you can use the `#pragma omp atomic` directive before each update statement, or where applicable, you could use the `#pragma omp critical` section to protect the block of updates, assuming it is small and won't cause much contention.""
    },
    {
      ""Question"": ""In the `kmeans_clustering` function, how can you prevent threads from interfering with each other's calculation of Euclidean distances in the loop where each point's nearest cluster center is found?"",
      ""Answer"": ""Preventing threads from interfering with each other's calculation of Euclidean distances can be achieved by making the local variables inside the loop private to each thread. This is naturally handled if you apply a loop-level parallelism using `#pragma omp parallel for` where each iteration is independent as it operates on different data points.""
    },
    {
      ""Question"": ""What technique can be used to efficiently parallelize the nested loops when updating the `new_centers` in `kmeans_clustering`?"",
      ""Answer"": ""To parallelize the nested loops when updating `new_centers`, you can employ a collapse clause with the `#pragma omp parallel for` directive that will flatten the nested loops into one large loop and distribute iterations across the threads. Additionally, optimizations like loop fusion or blocking may be considered for further performance improvements.""

  ""Questions"": [
    {
      ""Question"": ""How can the parallelized loop over 'npoints' inside the 'do-while' loop potentially be optimized?"",
      ""Answer"": ""The loop over 'npoints' can be optimized by ensuring that the workload is evenly distributed among threads, possibly by experimenting with different scheduling strategies such as dynamic or guided if the static schedule does not produce optimal results. Additionally, optimizing the memory access pattern and reducing false sharing by considering padding or private copies of frequently accessed variables can help improve performance.""
    },
    {
      ""Question"": ""What is the impact of 'firstprivate' clause on the performance in the '#pragma omp for' loop and can it be optimized?"",
      ""Answer"": ""The 'firstprivate' clause ensures that each thread receives a private copy of the specified variables with their original values. While this can be beneficial for certain scenarios, it may introduce unnecessary overhead if those variables do not need to be private or their original values are not required. Removing firstprivate for variables that do not need to be private can optimize performance by reducing this overhead.""
    },
    {
      ""Question"": ""How can the reduction variable 'delta' affect the scalability of the OpenMP code and what are potential optimization strategies?"",
      ""Answer"": ""Reduction operations can introduce contention and serialization at the end of the parallel region as all threads need to update the shared reduction variable. To optimize this, consider reducing the frequency of updates to the 'delta' variable, or using an atomic operation to update it. Alternatively, local reductions could be performed in thread-private variables before combining them at the end to reduce contention.""
    },
    {
      ""Question"": ""What performance issues can arise due to false sharing in the 'partial_new_centers_len' and 'partial_new_centers' arrays and how can they be mitigated?"",
      ""Answer"": ""False sharing can occur when multiple threads write to data that lies within the same cache line. This can lead to unnecessary cache invalidations and reduced performance. To mitigate false sharing, ensure that each thread's data is aligned to cache line boundaries or pad the data structures sufficiently to avoid overlap in cache lines accessed by different threads.""
    },
    {
      ""Question"": ""What is the purpose of the 'schedule(static)' clause, and under what circumstances might changing it improve performance?"",
      ""Answer"": ""The 'schedule(static)' clause is used to statically distribute iterations of the loop to threads in round-robin fashion. This is efficient when iterations have similar execution times. However, if iterations have significantly different execution times, using a dynamic schedule ('schedule(dynamic, chunk_size)') might improve performance by balancing the workload more evenly among threads.""
    },
    {
      ""Question"": ""Could using 'lastprivate' instead of 'firstprivate' on certain variables in the '#pragma omp for' loop yield better performance, and why?"",
      ""Answer"": ""Using 'lastprivate' instead of 'firstprivate' would not generally improve performance in this context, as 'lastprivate' is used to assign the value from the last iteration of the loop to the respective variable of the outside scope after the loop ends. In this code, there are no variables that would benefit from such behavior, and 'lastprivate' would not offer a performance advantage.""
    },
    {
      ""Question"": ""What potential performance implications does thread creation and termination within the 'do-while' loop have, and how can they be optimized?"",
      ""Answer"": ""The creation and termination of threads within each iteration of the 'do-while' loop could introduce significant overhead, particularly if the number of iterations is high. To optimize this, threads can be created once outside the loop using a parallel region and reusing them for each iteration using a work-sharing construct such as `#pragma omp for` inside the loop, if the loop iterations are independent.""
    },
    {
      ""Question"": ""How does performing frequent memory allocations/deallocations inside a parallel region affect performance?"",
      ""Answer"": ""Frequent memory allocations and deallocations inside a parallel region can lead to contention and degrade performance due to synchronization requirements and potential memory fragmentation. To optimize, allocations should be moved outside of parallel regions if possible, and reuse memory as much as possible to minimize allocation/deallocation overhead.""
    },
    {
      ""Question"": ""What are the performance considerations for using 'omp_set_num_threads(num_omp_threads)' within the 'do-while' loop?"",
      ""Answer"": ""Using 'omp_set_num_threads' within the loop could lead to unnecessary overhead in adjusting the number of threads for each iteration especially if the number of threads is not changing. It is generally better to set the number of threads once outside the loop and only change it if there is a clear performance benefit from dynamically adjusting the number of threads.""
    },
    {
      ""Question"": ""Can the data initialization for 'clusters', 'new_centers', and 'partial_new_centers' arrays be improved for better performance, particularly with respect to parallel execution?"",
      ""Answer"": ""Data initialization can be improved to better align with parallel execution. Initialization of these arrays could be parallelized to take advantage of multiple threads, thereby speeding up the initial setup. Ensuring that each thread initializes a block of memory that it will also process can also help with locality and cache efficiency.""

            ""Question"": ""After parallelizing the seed array initialization, how would you determine if the parallelization was effective in terms of performance?"",
            ""Answer"": ""To determine if parallelization was effective, I would measure the execution time of the parallel and serial versions of the code, possibly using OpenMP's `omp_get_wtime()` function, and compare the results. A significant reduction in time would indicate effective parallelization.""

 Generate JSON of 10 open-ended OpenMP performance optimization questions based on the above code snippet. Each question must be a JSON object with keys: Question: <generated question>, Answer: <Correct answer to the generated question>.","{
  ""Question1"": {
    ""Question"": ""What is the purpose of using '#pragma omp parallel for' in the given code snippet?"",
    ""Answer"": ""The purpose of using '#pragma omp parallel for' is to parallelize the loop over chunks to improve performance by distributing the iterations across multiple threads created by OpenMP. This allows the work of computing matrix chunk results in the 'single_iteration' function to be performed concurrently.""
  },
  ""Question2"": {
    ""Question"": ""Why is the number of threads set explicitly in the code with 'omp_set_num_threads(num_omp_threads)'?"",
    ""Answer"": ""The number of threads is set explicitly to control the level of concurrency in the parallel region, ensuring that a specific number of threads are used for parallel execution. This can impact performance and is typical in optimization to match the number of threads to the hardware capabilities or to the nature of the problem.""
  },
  ""Question3"": {
    ""Question"": ""What do the BLOCK_SIZE_R and BLOCK_SIZE_C macros represent, and how can changing their values affect the performance?"",
    ""Answer"": ""BLOCK_SIZE_R and BLOCK_SIZE_C represent the number of rows and columns, respectively, in each block to be processed in the matrix chunk. Changing their values can affect cache utilization, data locality, and the amount of work each thread performs, thereby affecting performance. The optimal block size can minimize cache misses and balance the load among threads.""
  },
  ""Question4"": {
    ""Question"": ""How can the schedule(static) clause in the OpenMP pragma affect the performance of the parallel region?"",
    ""Answer"": ""The schedule(static) clause assigns iterations in equal-sized chunks to each thread in a round-robin fashion at compile time. It can benefit workloads with uniformly distributed work per iteration. However, if the workload is unbalanced, this can lead to suboptimal load balancing and performance issues.""
  },
  ""Question5"": {
    ""Question"": ""Why might it be important to consider the target hardware architecture, like the presence of MIC (Many Integrated Cores), when optimizing the OpenMP code?"",
    ""Answer"": ""Different architectures have varying memory hierarchies, vectorization capabilities, and core counts, which impact how OpenMP directives and code structure can be optimized. For instance, on MIC architectures, you may exploit wide vector units and high thread scalability differently from mainstream CPUs.""
  },
  ""Question6"": {
    ""Question"": ""What is the use of firstprivate(row, col, num_chunk, chunks_in_row) in the OpenMP clause?"",
    ""Answer"": ""By declaring these variables as firstprivate, each thread gets its own copy initialized with the value of the variable present in the master thread at the time the parallel region is entered. This ensures that all threads can access their own copies of these variables without causing race conditions.""
  },
  ""Question7"": {
    ""Question"": ""What role does the variable 'delta' play in the parallel region, and why is it private to each thread?"",
    ""Answer"": ""The 'delta' variable stores the computed value for temperature changes for the current cell in the simulation. It is private to each thread to prevent data races since each thread computes 'delta' for different cells independently.""
  },
  ""Question8"": {
    ""Question"": ""What could be the potential impact of memory-bound operations on the performance of the OpenMP parallel regions, and how can this be mitigated?"",
    ""Answer"": ""Memory-bound operations can lead to processor stalls if the threads are waiting for data to be fetched from memory. Performance can be improved by enhancing data locality, using contiguous data layouts, reducing memory footprint to fit within caches, and by applying techniques like loop tiling to optimize memory access patterns.""
  },
  ""Question9"": {
    ""Question"": ""How does the chunk division strategy (number of chunks in a row and column) of the grid affect load balancing among threads?"",
    ""Answer"": ""The strategy for dividing the grid into chunks can significantly affect load balancing, as it determines the distribution of the computation work among threads. Uniform chunk division helps in evenly distributing the workload, whereas uneven chunk division can lead to some threads being idle while others are still working, leading to inefficiency.""
  },
  ""Question10"": {
    ""Question"": ""Explain the advantage of using block-based computation in terms of cache efficiency and reduction of boundary conditions checks."",
    ""Answer"": ""By using block-based computation, more of the data needed for computation can be kept in the fast cache memory closer to the CPU, reducing the time spent accessing slower main memory. It also reduces the number of boundary condition checks, as much of the processing is done on interior blocks with predetermined size, where boundary conditions are less frequently encountered.""

  ""Question4"": {
    ""Question"": ""Which OpenMP clause is used in the code to ensure variables are correctly shared or private among threads?"",
    ""Answer"": ""The code uses the `shared` and `private` clauses in the `#pragma omp parallel for` directive to define the shared and private variables for each thread within the parallel region.""
  },
  ""Question5"": {
    ""Question"": ""Why is the computation of 'sum' and 'sum2' not included within the OpenMP parallel region?"",
    ""Answer"": ""The computation of 'sum' and 'sum2' involves a reduction operation over the elements of the Region of Interest (ROI), which requires accumulation of values. Parallelizing this directly without proper handling could result in a race condition. It's either handled outside the parallel region or would need a reduction clause within the parallel region to be parallelized safely.""
  },
  ""Question6"": {
    ""Question"": ""What performance issues need to be considered when using nested loops in the OpenMP parallel region?"",
    ""Answer"": ""When using nested loops in OpenMP, it is important to consider load balancing among threads, avoiding the creation of too many threads which could lead to overhead, potential false sharing of cache lines between threads, and efficient use of the memory hierarchy to prevent bottlenecks.""
  },
  ""Question7"": {
    ""Question"": ""How does the use of loop index variables 'i' and 'j' as private affect the performance of the OpenMP-parallelized loops?"",
    ""Answer"": ""Making loop index variables 'i' and 'j' private ensures that each thread has its own independent copy, which eliminates contention and potential race conditions when these variables are updated, thus improving performance.""
  },
  ""Question8"": {
    ""Question"": ""What kind of scheduling could be applied to the OpenMP loop to potentially optimize performance, and why?"",
    ""Answer"": ""Different scheduling types like 'static', 'dynamic', or 'guided' can be applied to distribute the workload among threads. Dynamic scheduling can be useful when iterations take variable time to complete, while static scheduling may provide better cache usage when iterations take approximately the same time.""
  },
  ""Question9"": {
    ""Question"": ""What would be a safe way to parallelize the ROI mean and variance calculations to ensure there are no race conditions?"",
    ""Answer"": ""A safe way to parallelize the ROI mean and variance calculations while preventing race conditions is to use the `reduction` clause in an OpenMP pragma directive, which allows the summation to occur in a thread-safe manner by performing the operation separately in each thread and then combining the results.""
  },
  ""Question10"": {
    ""Question"": ""Is there any potential for vectorization in this code, and if so, where and how could it be applied?"",
    ""Answer"": ""Yes, there is potential for vectorization in the nested loops where each pixel's computation is independent of the others. Compiler auto-vectorization could be leveraged, or explicit vector intrinsics could be used to process multiple pixels simultaneously, particularly in the part of the code where iterative SRAD calculations are performed.""

  ""Questions"": [
    {
      ""Question"": ""What compiler directive is needed to enable the parallel execution of the for loop that calculates the top and left perimeter blocks in the `lud_omp` function?"",
      ""Answer"": ""To enable parallel execution, the `#pragma omp parallel for` directive is used right before the for loop that calculates the perimeter blocks. In the provided code, this is already done.""
    },
    {
      ""Question"": ""How can the performance of the SIMD operations in the code be improved when running on CPUs with a different alignment requirement?"",
      ""Answer"": ""Performance can be improved by making sure that the data used for SIMD operations is properly aligned for the target CPU's requirements. In the code, alignment is specified using `__attribute__ ((aligned (64)))`. If the CPU has different alignment requirements, this value should be changed accordingly to match the CPU's cache line size or vector register width.""
    },
    {
      ""Question"": ""What environment variable could be set to tune the number of threads used by OpenMP when executing the `lud_omp` function?"",
      ""Answer"": ""The environment variable `OMP_NUM_THREADS` can be set to specify the number of threads to use in OpenMP parallel regions before the program is run. For in-program control, the function `omp_set_num_threads(int num_threads)` is used as shown in the code snippet.""
    },
    {
      ""Question"": ""Why might the `schedule(auto)` clause be beneficial when used with the `#pragma omp parallel for` directive in the update of interior block matrices?"",
      ""Answer"": ""Using the `schedule(auto)` clause allows the OpenMP runtime to automatically choose the most appropriate scheduling method based on the loop's characteristics and system workload at runtime. This can potentially improve load balancing and overall runtime performance because the runtime has the flexibility to optimize the scheduling.""
    },
    {
      ""Question"": ""What is the purpose of the `default(none)` clause in the OpenMP pragma, and how does it affect the code?"",
      ""Answer"": ""The `default(none)` clause requires that all variables used in the OpenMP block be explicitly scoped, either as shared, private, firstprivate, or similar. This prevents accidental sharing or privatizing of variables and leads to more explicit and safer parallel code by reducing the chance of data races or unintended behavior.""
    },
    {
      ""Question"": ""How does offloading with OpenMP work, and which part of the code is affected by it in the provided snippet?"",
      ""Answer"": ""OpenMP offloading allows portions of the code to run on a different device, such as a GPU or coprocessor. In the code snippet, the offloading is achieved with the `#pragma omp target` directive. It affects the `lud_omp` function by mapping the necessary data (`a` array) to the target device and executing the code on it. Any portion of the code wrapped between `#ifdef OMP_OFFLOAD` and `#endif` is specifically tailored for offloading if it's enabled during compilation.""
    },
    {
      ""Question"": ""What considerations should be taken into account for choosing the number of threads for the MIC architecture within the `lud_omp` function?"",
      ""Answer"": ""When choosing the number of threads for the MIC architecture, consider factors like the number of physical and logical cores available, the nature of the workload, and threading overhead. It's important to avoid oversubscription of threads and to ensure that the workload is sufficiently parallelizable to benefit from the additional threads.""
    },
    {
      ""Question"": ""How does the `omp_set_num_threads` function affect the OpenMP parallel regions, and what impact does it have in the context of the `lud_omp` function?"",
      ""Answer"": ""The `omp_set_num_threads` function sets the number of threads to be used in subsequent parallel regions within the calling thread's team. In the context of the `lud_omp` function, it sets the number of threads that will be used for the parallel execution of the LU decomposition algorithm. Correct tuning of this value is crucial for achieving optimal performance.""
    },
    {
      ""Question"": ""In case of NUMA (Non-Uniform Memory Access) machines, what additional OpenMP features or considerations might improve the performance of the `lud_omp` function?"",
      ""Answer"": ""For NUMA machines, OpenMP features like `proc_bind` clause or the usage of `OMP_PLACES` environment variable can be used to control thread affinity and ensure that threads are executed on cores that have faster access to the memory where data resides. Additionally, using `first-touch` policy by initializing data in parallel for better memory locality can improve performance.""
    },
    {
      ""Question"": ""What could be the potential downside of using a large block size (BS) for the algorithm, and how can OpenMP be used to mitigate it?"",
      ""Answer"": ""A large block size may lead to a cache locality issue as the data may not fit into the cache, causing cache misses and leading to performance degradation. To mitigate this, OpenMP can be used to schedule chunks of the loop iterations such that they fit into the cache (`#pragma omp parallel for schedule(dynamic, chunk_size)`), where `chunk_size` can be tuned to match the cache size or to have better load balancing among threads.""
