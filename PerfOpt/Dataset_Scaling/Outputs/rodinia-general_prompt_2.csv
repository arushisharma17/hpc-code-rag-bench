        ""Question"": ""Is using nested parallelism likely to result in performance improvement?"",
        ""Answer"": ""No""

        ""Question"": ""For optimal performance, should you typically ensure the number of threads is not significantly greater than the number of processing cores?"",
        ""Answer"": ""Yes""

        ""Question"": ""Is declaring less often accessed shared data with the 'firstprivate' clause recommended for optimization?"",
