""Question"": ""Which OpenMP clause is used to define private variables?"",
""Options"": {
""A"": ""#pragma omp private"",
""B"": ""#pragma omp for"",

{
""Question"": ""What does the OpenMP 'collapse' clause do?"",
""Options"": {
""A"": ""It collapses parallel region into single execution thread"",
""B"": ""It utilizes multiple iterations of loop into single iteration group"",
""C"": ""It combines multiple sequential threads into one thread"",
""D"": ""It collapses multiple variables into a single variable""
},
""Answer"": ""B""
},

{
""Question"": ""What is the benefit of using the 'nowait' clause in OpenMP?"",
""Options"": {
""A"": ""It allows the system to assign tasks to idle threads"",
""B"": ""It allows threads to move on without waiting for others at the end of parallel region"",
""C"": ""It improves memory utilization"",
""D"": ""It enables the use of SIMD instructions""
},
""Answer"": ""B""
},

{
""Question"": ""Which solution is useful for false sharing problem in OpenMP?"",
""Options"": {
""A"": ""Using thread private variables"",
""B"": ""Increasing the number of threads"",
""C"": ""Using atomic operations"",
""D"": ""Restructuring the computation""

""Answer"": ""A""
},

{
""Question"": ""What's the effect of the OpenMP 'atomic' directive?"",
""Options"": {
""A"": ""It ensures that a specific variable is shared among all threads"",
""B"": ""It ensures that a particular section of code is executed by a single thread at a time"",
""C"": ""It ensures a specific operation of read-modify-write is done atomically without being interrupted"",
""D"": ""It breaks down a task into multiple sub-tasks to be processed in parallel""
},
""Answer"": ""C""
},

{
""Question"": ""Which OpenMP directive is used to parallelize a for loop?"",
""Options"": {
""A"": ""#pragma omp parallel"",
""B"": ""#pragma omp for"",
""C"": ""#pragma omp section"",
""D"": ""#pragma omp master""
},
""Answer"": ""B""
},

{
""Question"": ""In OpenMP, what is the purpose of '#pragma omp master'?"",
""Options"": {
""A"": ""It restricts execution of the following structured block to the master thread only"",
""B"": ""It parallels the execution of the following structured block"",
""C"": ""It ensures the synchronization of all threads"",
""D"": ""It avoids race condition""
},
""Answer"": ""A""
},

{
""Question"": ""What's the purpose of using the 'schedule' clause in OpenMP?"",
""Options"": {
""A"": ""To specify how loop iterations are divided among threads"",
""B"": ""To synchronize threads"",
""C"": ""To merge multiple threads into one"",
""D"": ""To specify the maximum number of threads in a team""
},
""Answer"": ""A""
},

{
""Question"": ""What does the 'threadprivate' directive do in OpenMP?"",
""Options"": {
""A"": ""It makes global variables private to each thread"",
""B"": ""It specifies the maximum number of threads that should be used"",
""C"": ""It synchronizes all threads"",
""D"": ""It distributes loop iterations among threads""
},
""Answer"": ""A""
},

{
""Question"": ""What is the role of the 'reduction' clause in OpenMP?"",
""Options"": {
""A"": ""To consolidate the size of the code"",
""B"": ""To perform parallel reduction operations like summation or finding max/min"",
""C"": ""To reduce the number of threads used by the program"",
""D"": ""To reduce the memory used by the program""
},
""Answer"": ""B""
