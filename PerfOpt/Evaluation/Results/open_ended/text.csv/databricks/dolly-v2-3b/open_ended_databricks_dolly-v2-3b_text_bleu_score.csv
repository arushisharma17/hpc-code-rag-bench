"You are an openmp performance optimization expert. Provide useful, complete, and logically correct answers to performance optimization questions based on the given code samples. #pragma omp parallel shared (a, b) private (c,d) \n { ... \n  #pragma omp critical \n { a += 2 * c; c = d * d; }} What is the performance issue in the given code snippet? ","The private section of the shared clause can be replaced by a shared section, which eliminates the need for i and ++i.","Without the critical region, the first statement here leads to a data race. The second statement however involves private data only and unnecessarily increases the time taken to execute this construct.",1.5660478384449766e-47,False

","The performance issue in the given code snippet is the lack of work-sharing between the N loops, specifically the work-sharing between loops 1 and N. Without work-sharing, the number of statically scheduling OpenMP tasks will be N^2, where N is the number of iterations of a loop, which is clearly not a desirable OMP scheduling behavior.",Multiple combined parallel work-sharing loops. Each parallelized loop adds to the parallel overhead and has an implied barrier that cannot be omitted.,7.549059256441118e-48,False
