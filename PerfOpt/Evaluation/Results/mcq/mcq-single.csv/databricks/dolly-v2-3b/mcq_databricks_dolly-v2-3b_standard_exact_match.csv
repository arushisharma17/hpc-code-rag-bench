"Answer the following multiple choice question about openmp performance optimization. The output should be the correct answer restricted to a single option letter 'A', 'B', 'C' or 'D' from the four options. #define N 100\nint A[N];\nint B[N];\n\nvoid init() {\n  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {\n    A[i] = i;\n  }\n}\n\nvoid add() {\n  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {\n    B[i] = A[i] + 1;\n  }\n}\n\nvoid foo() {\n  init();\n  add();\n}\n  How can we optimize the performance of the given code snippet?  Options: A. Avoid column-major array access in C/C++ B. Declare global variables as function parameters C. Avoid calls to mathematical functions with higher precision than required D. Missing array range in data copy to the GPU","Option D. Avoid calls to mathematical functions with higher precision than required is correct. The code needs to use OpenMP to take advantage of OpenMP's task-parallelism and vectorization capabilities. However, it does not use sufficient precision and is thus not effective.",B,False
"Answer the following multiple choice question about openmp performance optimization. The output should be the correct answer restricted to a single option letter 'A', 'B', 'C' or 'D' from the four options. float calc_div(float a, float b, float c) {\n    return a / b / c;\n}\n Code2: float calc_div(float a, float b, float c) {\n    return a / (b * c);\n}\n How can we optimize the performance of the given code snippet?  Options: A. Consider loop interchange by promoting the scalar reduction variable to an array B. Missing array range in data copy to the GPU C. Replace two divisions with a division and a multiplication D. Avoid calls to mathematical functions with higher precision than required","The answer is 'D'. We can avoid calls to mathematical functions with higher precision than required as the function 'calc_div' in the code snippet is not dependant on any floating point calculations, hence no intermediate values need to be computed as part of the mathematical function, avoiding the need for any floating point calculations in the code.",C,False
