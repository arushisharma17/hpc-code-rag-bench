Prompt,Response,Correct Answer,Is Correct
"Answer the following multiple choice question about openmp performance optimization. The output should be the correct answer restricted to a single option letter 'A', 'B', 'C' or 'D' from the four options. #define N 100\nint A[N];\nint B[N];\n\nvoid init() {\n  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {\n    A[i] = i;\n  }\n}\n\nvoid add() {\n  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {\n    B[i] = A[i] + 1;\n  }\n}\n\nvoid foo() {\n  init();\n  add();\n}\n  How can we optimize the performance of the given code snippet?  Options: A. Avoid column-major array access in C/C++ B. Declare global variables as function parameters C. Avoid calls to mathematical functions with higher precision than required D. Missing array range in data copy to the GPU",The correct answer is C,B,False
"Answer the following multiple choice question about openmp performance optimization.

Options: A. Consider loop interchange by promoting the scalar reduction variable to an array B. Missing array range in data copy to the GPU C. Replace two divisions with a division and a multiplication D. Avoid calls to mathematical functions with higher precision than required","The correct answer is C.The performance of OpenMP parallelized code can be optimized by:Considering loop interchange: If the order of loops in the code can be changed to improve the memory access pattern, this can result in better cache locality and reduce the number of memory accesses.",C,True
