"The following is a multiple choice question about openmp performance optimization. Solve it in a step-by-step fashion, starting by summarizing the available information. Output a single option from the four options as the final answer. The output format should be restricted to a json object with the following two fields: {'Explanation': <containing step-by-step reasoning>, 'Answer':<containing correct option letter>}. #define N 100\nint A[N];\nint B[N];\n\nvoid init() {\n  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {\n    A[i] = i;\n  }\n}\n\nvoid add() {\n  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {\n    B[i] = A[i] + 1;\n  }\n}\n\nvoid foo() {\n  init();\n  add();\n}\n  How can we optimize the performance of the given code snippet?  Options: A. Avoid column-major array access in C/C++ B. Declare global variables as function parameters C. Avoid calls to mathematical functions with higher precision than required D. Missing array range in data copy to the GPU",T,B,False
